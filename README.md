Real-Time Location Tracking App

This is a real-time location tracking application built using Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Leaflet.js for mapping. The app tracks users' locations in real-time and updates them on a map using WebSockets.

Features:

1. Real-time location sharing: Users can share their geolocation, and the app will update their position on the map in real-time.
2. Multiple users: Supports multiple users, each represented by a marker on the map.
3. Disconnect handling: Removes the marker when a user disconnects from the app.
4. Map rendering: Uses Leaflet.js to render maps with OpenStreetMap tiles.
